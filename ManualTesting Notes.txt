Module 1: Software testing concepts 

Module 2: Software Testing Project

Module 3: Agile Methodology(Scrum Framework) + JIRA tool 

Module 4: SQL or Database Testing 


Automation : ( Java + Selenium )		

API Testing : (Postman)

Mobile Testing : (Appium)

------------------------------------------------------------
Manaul Testing : 

Module 1: Software testing concepts 

Software Testing : 

System S/W : 

e.g - Operating system , Drivers 

Programming Software: 

e.g -  Compilers , Interpreters , debugging tools etc ..

Application Software : 

Web apps , Stand alone apps , mobile apps , Silver lite , Mainframe apps , etc ...

Testing : 

It's a process of checking the developed software is working as per client business requirements or not.

-> to find bugs 
-> to maintain quality

The prime motto of testing is to deliver 
a quality and risk free product.

Terminoligies in Software Testing :

1) Product : if a software application is developed for a multiple users (clients) 
e.g : NCR companies product for ATM machines 

2) Project : if a software application is developed for a single user(client)
e.g : TCS is developing banking app for Bank of America using a Fidelity Product 

3)Error : Any incorrect results due to human actions

4)Bug/Defect/Issue/Fault: if the expected results are deviated from actual results 

5) Failure / Incident : if end user finds the mistake while using the application 

What do we test in now-a-days applications ?

1) Functionalities
2) UI or GUI Testing
3) Usability 
4) Performance Testing
5) Load Testing
6) Security Testing 
7) Compatability 

Roles or Duties of Tester :

1) Understanding the Application under Test (Domain Expertise)
2) Formal Testing (Writing the Test cases and executing them)
3) Adhoc TEsting (No Test cases)
4) Finding defects and reporting to developer
5) Retesting and regression testing
6) Develop automation scripts
7) excecute automation scripts
8) Analyse results
9) publish reports 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software Testing :

the process of checking are we developing right software or not and also
checking the developed software is working as per client business requirements or not.

Software Testing  = Verification +  Validation


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software Testing Principles :

1) Exhaustive testing is impossible 
2) Defect Clustering
3) Pesticide Paradox
4) Early Testing 
5) Testing is application dependent  / sometimes situation dependent
6) Testing should show presence of defects 
7) Absence of defects is fallacy

SDLC  - Software development life cycle 			
Requirements gathering (Business Analysts/ Sales Team / SME's subject matter experts etc)
					==> BRD -Business requirement docuement
					==> BRS - Business requirement specifictaion 
					==> SRS - System requirement specifictaion
					==> FRS - Functional requirement specifictaion

analysis and planning (Project Manager / Product Owner / Test Manager)
					==> Project plan
					==> Test plan
					
Deisgn (Solution Architects / System Architects / UX Developer)
				==> HLD High level deisgn
				==>Low Level Design  
				
Coding (Developers)
			==> source code ==>  build 
			
Testing (Testers / Developers)
			==> Test Scenarios
			==> Test Cases
			==> RTM (Requirement Traceabilty matrix)
Production (Production support team)
			
						SDLC Models 
						
			1) Sequential Models 				2)Iterative or Incremental Models
				- Waterfall Model					- RAD Model (Rapid Application Development)
				- V model							- Prototype Model
													- Spiral Model
													- Agile MOdel 
				
- Waterfall Model	
  small project 
  requirement are clear 
- V model 
  small projects 
  requirement are not clear 
- RAD Model 
  big projects 
  here project to be completed in short span of time 
			
- Prototype Model 
  big projects 
  requirement are not clear and client will refer to some reference application  
  
- Spiral Model 
  big projects 
  requirement are dependent on other requirements

=================================================================
Functional System Testing types :

1) Smoke Testing or Build acceptance Testing 
2) Formal Testing (writing and executing the test cases )
3) Retesting 
4) Regression Testing
5) Sanity Testing 

  subset of regression testing 
6) Priority based testing 
7) End to End Testing 

Special Functional System Testing types :

1) Benchmark Testing 
2) Exploratory Testing 
3) Monkey or Gorilla Testing 

Non-Functional System Testing types :

1) UI or GUI testing 
2) Usability testing 
3) Performance Testing 
	Reponsiveness 
	Stability 
 below parameters will be used 
	i) reponse time
	ii) processing time
	iii) concurrent user volume
	
Load TEsting :

i) Stress Testing
ii) Spike Testing 
iii) Soak testing 
iv) user volume testing 

4) Security Testing 
5) Compatability testing
6) Globalization or Internationalization or I18N testing 	
7) Localization Testing 
8) Installation testing 
9) UnInstallation testing 
10) Recovery Testing
